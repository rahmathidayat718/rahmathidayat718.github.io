This section showcases my hands-on projects in automation testing using Selenium and Python. Each project is built with a focus on best practices, employing the Page Object Model (POM) approach and covering key aspects such as CRUD operations, data-driven testing with Excel, and generating detailed reports using pytest.

These projects reflect my dedication to mastering Quality Assurance and my ability to deliver efficient, reliable, and well-structured automated tests.
